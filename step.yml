  Downloads and Runs a bash script stored on a private GitHub repo.

  ### Configuring the Step

  Before using the step, you need to push your bash script into a private GitHub repository and set up a GitHub personal access token with read permission on the same repository.

  1. The "file raw path" param expects the full path of the script file
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{owner}/{repo}/{branch}/{file}"

  2. The "run script" param indicates that the script should be run after the download
  "yes" to run the bash script and "no" to just download the raw file

  3. The "github access token" param must be a Bitrise Secret config

  ### Troubleshooting

  If the Step fails, check if the given GitHub Personal Access Token has read permission on the script's repository.
